# Sustainable Flight Initiative
Repository of information, data and software for the pursuit of Sustainable Flight

## Introduction:
The world has to transition to a sustainable way of life or we will exhaust our resources and pollute and disprut our an environment so much that life will become unstable for an increasing number of species and eventually humanity. We can choose to remain part of the problem, or strive to be part of the solution. This applies to all aspects of life, from food, housing, work, transport to leisure.  The sooner we transition the better the outcome and quality of life we can enjoy.

This is the beginning of a collection of projects that strive to create practical solutions for making all forms of aviation sustainable, taking the initiative from the ground up, from indiviuals and groups that freely share experitise, designs, methods, from components through to complete software and aircraft solutions. Taking inspiration from the success of open source/free software and the communities that develop them, this initiative aims to open up and advance systainable aviation for the individual hobbyist through to corporations that build and operate commercial transport and passenger aircraft.

## High level Plan
* Create repository to hold information, data and software and facilitate discussions
* Reach out to pulblic and businesses to collaborate on making flight sustainable
* Identify software, hardware components, aircraft and infrastructure that exist, are in development or need to be developed
* Create events that help promote the transition to sustainable flight such as competitions, air shows & conferences
* Engage with government bodies when legislation should be ammended, or new legislation is needed to faciltate the transition

## Example projects that could be part of, or associated with, the Sustainable Flight Inititive
* Aerodynamic, structure and flight dynamics analysis and visualzation software
* CAD/CAM software to help design and build components through to whole aircaft
* Flight simulator software to educate, train and entertain through to training AI for autopilots
* Flight instrument software and hardware from basic varios and alitimeters, through to navigation software and autopilots
* Autonmous flight testing of experimental aircraft
* Software and hardware for electric winch towing of gliders (paragliders, hang gliders and sailplanes) & aircraft with sustainer motors
* Software and hardware for powering electric winches through to charging batteries
* Development of a new generation of sustainable aircraft:
    * Paragliders
    * Hang gliders
    * Sailplanes
    * Light electric aircraft, eVTOL, eSTOL and conventional powered aircraft
    * Autonmous Tug and in-flight charging aircraft
 * Sustainable flight competitions where all ground transport through to winch, tug and aircraft are powered in a sustainable way, with competition results geared towards factors that drive utility and efficiency improvements.
